Code for the final assignment in the course Machine and Deep Learning
## Necessary libraries:
To successfully run the code the following libraries are needed:
pandas, numpy, warnings, networkx, random, sklearn, nltk, json, gensim, time, catboost, scipy, re, lightgbm, matplotlib
## Data location:
All the provided files need to be in the same folder ('Code-Folder') as the Final-Code.ipynb file and keep the same names as they had originally (train.csv, test.csv, abstracts.txt, coauthorship.edgelist, author_papers.txt).
The file to submit will be saved in the same folder as submission_second.csv.
## Run code:
All the necessary code is in the Final-Code-Submision.ipynb, the other files were used for evaluating certain features and models and are not needed for reproduction.
